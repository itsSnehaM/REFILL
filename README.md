## Description

Sustainable development is a term we often hear. What does it really mean? This is the type of development that satisfies the needs of the present, while making sure that future generations will still be able to satisfy their needs. Refill has been developed addressing this. This application provides users with access to a community and the ability to share their views. With Refill, we are looking forward to utilizing the funds collected for accomplishing the goals of sustainable development.


### What's the problem?

Almost everyone understands the need to grow their economies, but not everyone realizes the negative effects unbalanced economic growth can have on the environment. It is time to change this by looking at the world differently, and sustainable development goals will help us do that. The big picture is to make everyone's lives better and achieve everything together. Details, however, are crucial. Both lifestyles and economies need to grow, so we wish both to prosper. New innovative technologies should be developed without causing harm to the environment. Regardless of where we live, everyone needs access to healthy food. We also want clean drinking water and sanitation, free education and much more in the next ten years. Through our application, we are concerned and have a vision to uplift these sections.

### How can this project help?
 
By using Refill, users will be able to connect with like-minded individuals who are committed to sustainable development. They can donate money to support the different campaigns we will conduct to meet the needs of the people. We believe that something big can be achieved starting with small steps. In future, we aim to improve the application to facilitate collaboration with social workers and NGOs in sessions and through special projects. Nonetheless, so far, it is incredibly powerful and easy to use in creating significant change.

### The idea 

The web has made it easier than ever to connect with people and easily accomplish our tasks through internet use. What we are trying to create is an interactive web app that states all the tasks and goals of our community. We believe that a little bit of help from everyone can go a long way. As communities are a great source of ideas and knowledge, we strive to keep it simple and not chaotic with blog posts and a feature to donate money.
